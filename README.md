# Ultimate Benchmark List

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to compiling an extensive list of benchmarking sites. This README file aims to provide a clear and structured overview of the various resources available for testing and evaluating the performance of various computer components and services, including CPUs, RAM, CDNs, security, and more.
Repository Objective

The main goal of this repository is to centralize a comprehensive and regularly updated list of reliable and recognized benchmarking sites. This project is intended to assist IT professionals, technology enthusiasts, and anyone interested in evaluating computer performance.

## Categories

This repository categorizes benchmark sites into various sections for easier navigation and reference. Each category includes a brief description and a list of relevant benchmarking sites.
